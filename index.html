	<h3> <p> Pandas are cuddly, gentle creatures. Online photographs of grinning people hugging baby pandas may suggest that giant pandas would make perfect pets. ... And in 2007, the first captive-born male reintroduced into the wild died after an apparent fight with other pandas. Attacks on humans are relatively unusual.</p> </h3>

	<h3> <mark>Speciality:</mark> 
	They have great camouflage for their environment. The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication. Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats.</h3>
